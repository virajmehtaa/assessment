Matrix Multiplication in C:-

This project demonstrates matrix multiplication using 2D arrays in C.  
The program takes two matrices as input from the user, displays them, multiplies them, and shows the result matrix in a clean format.

📌 Features
- Uses 2D arrays for matrix storage.
- Interactive input for elements.
- Displays matrices in matrix format.
- Performs matrix multiplication only if dimensions are valid.
- Uses functions for better readability:
  - `inputMatrix()` → Takes user input and prints matrix.
  - `multiplyMatrices()` → Performs multiplication.
  - `displayResult()` → Prints the result matrix.
- Validates rule: columns of Matrix 1 = rows of Matrix 2.
